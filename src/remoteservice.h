 * @class RemoteService remoteservice.h KDNSSD/RemoteService
 * @short Describes a service published over DNS-SD,
 *        typically on a remote machine
 *
 * This class allows delayed or asynchronous resolution of
 * services.  As the name suggests, the service is normally
 * on a remote machine, but the service could just as easily
 * be published on the local machine.
 *
 * RemoteService instances are normally provided by ServiceBrowser,
 * but can be used to resolve any service if you know the name, type
 * and domain for it.
